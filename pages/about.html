    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m a Computer Engineering student at Cal Poly SLO graduating in Spring 2026, 
        with experience across AI research, embedded systems, full-stack development, 
        and robotics. I’ve contributed to AI model development at e2f, built web 
        applications using modern frameworks, and am currently developing an 
        autonomous rover system for my senior Capstone project. 
        I enjoy solving complex problems, working across hardware and software, 
        and collaborating in fast-moving technical environments. 
        I’m especially interested in embedded systems, robotics, 
        and intelligent software platforms.</p>
